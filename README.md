# The 1975 Band Website

## [link to the website](https://the-1975.herokuapp.com/)

### Overview
* This is a website that I created using front-end design and back-end route handling logic for the forum and chat features. The 1975 are one of my favorite bands so I decided to check out their website, and I thought "Hey, I could totally recreate this and put my own spin on it."

### Features
* Home page with navbar, links to all of the band's social sites, links to the band's online music sites, and embedded music video.
* Discography page dynamically displays all of the band's albums. If an album is clicked on, it will direct you to the individual album page, which is also displayed dynamically from a main JSON file. Includes embedded spotify player that will play a 30 second sample of the song.
* Forum page where the site visitor can leave a note about the band
* Chat page where the site visitor can chat with any other online site visitor
